- Changed for loop to a for each loop as it is a iterator in teh background
- removed else stamenet since code will continue if doesnt meet criteria anyways
- changed int to Integer as the comaprison operator between is slightly more efficient
	-> L124 prevent auto unboxing
	-> L117 stays int because when increment Integer, new object always created, int is more efficient with incrementals
